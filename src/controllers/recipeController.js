    const prompt = `You are an expert chef and recipe generator. Your task is to generate three distinct recipes based on the provided leftover ingredients, user preferences, and desired output language. All textual output—including dish names, descriptions, ingredient names, instructions, and all property values—must be fully in the provided language.

Each recipe must strictly reflect the provided cuisine if one is given and it is not "any". If the provided cuisine is "any" or is missing/invalid, then do not apply any specific culinary tradition and set the cuisine to "none".

### Important Rules:
1. Use the given **ingredients** and create three distinct, cohesive, and flavorful dishes. The given **ingredients** **must** be the main ingredients of the dish.
2. Check if each item in **ingredients** is a valid food; ignore any invalid items.
3. Remove duplicates from the **ingredients**.
4. If an ingredient is valid and new, add it to the main ingredients list.
5. Use the provided cuisine exactly as given:
   - If the cuisine is a specific valid value (e.g., "chinese"), every recipe must strictly reflect that style using appropriate ingredients, seasonings, techniques, and flavor profiles (for example, include soy sauce, ginger, garlic, scallions, rice vinegar, sesame oil, etc.) and set the output "cuisine" field to that value.
   - If the cuisine is "any" or is missing/invalid, do not enforce any specific culinary tradition and set the output "cuisine" field to "none".
6. Always return servings as "1".
7. Assign realistic portion sizes for each ingredient.
8. Generate additional complementary ingredients (such as seasonings, spices, and oils) that are specific to the provided cuisine and preferences; if no specific cuisine is applied, generate generic and versatile ingredients.
9. Generate clear and realistic step-by-step cooking instructions.
10. Provide a creative dish name and estimated cooking time.
11. Even if the spice level is above 0, the dish does not have to be overly spicy; use it only as a guideline to adjust spice intensity.
12. If the spiceLevel is higher than 0, ensure that at least one of the generated recipes is not spicy – its preference array should not include "Spicy", and its ingredients and instructions should reflect a non-spicy variant. If spiceLevel is 0, none of the generated recipes should be spicy.
13. All textual output—including dish names, descriptions, ingredient names, instructions, and all property values—must be entirely in the provided target language. Disregard the native language of the cuisine completely. For example, if the target language is Japanese, every word in the recipe must be in Japanese, even if the cuisine is Chinese.
14. Each recipe must include the following fields:
    - **id:** a unique id for the recipe.
    - **cuisine:** the provided cuisine name if specified and not "any"; otherwise "none". Translate the cuisine name into the target language. For example, if the cuisine is 'chinese' and the target language is Japanese, set the cuisine field to '中華料理' if that is the appropriate Japanese term.
    - **preference:** an array of strings containing only the applicable preferences for the recipe. Possible values are: "Traditional", "Quick cook", "Beginner friendly", "Microwave only", and "Spicy". Include a value only if the corresponding preference is true (for spice, include "Spicy" only if the recipe is intended to be spicy).
    - **title:** a creative and authentic dish name inspired by the provided cuisine (if applicable) and ingredients.
    - **description:** a brief yet engaging description of the dish, highlighting its key flavors, textures, and appeal.
    - **time:** a realistic cooking time based on the dish's complexity.
    - **servings:** always "1".
    - **calories:** estimated calories of the dish per 1 person.
    - **ingredients:** a list of valid ingredients. **For each ingredient, separate the numeric portion and the unit into two fields.** For example:
      - { "name": "{{ingredient 1}}", "portion": "{{portion size}}", "unit": "{{unit}}" }
      - { "name": "rice", "portion": "100", "unit": "g" }
    - **additionalIngredients:** complementary ingredients generated based on the provided cuisine and preferences. For each additional ingredient, separate the numeric portion and the unit into two fields.
      Important for Japanese output:
      - When generating the Japanese additionalIngredients, if the measurement includes Japanese units like "大さじ" or "小さじ" (or any similar measurement terms), make sure to split the numeric value from the unit.
      - Do not output combined strings like "大さじ1" or "小さじ1/2". Instead, separate them into "portion": "1" and "unit": "大さじ", or "portion": "1/2" and "unit": "小さじ", respectively.
    - **instructions:** clear, logical, and structured step-by-step cooking directions.
15. Return three different recipes in a JSON object with keys "0", "1", and "2". Each recipe must include a unique id.
16. Add emojis to title and inside ingredients name and instructions if possible

---

### Input Format:
{
  "ingredients": ${ingredients},
  "preferences": {
    traditional: ${preferences.traditional},
    quickCook: ${preferences.quickCook},
    beginner: ${preferences.beginner},
    microwaveOnly: ${preferences.microwaveOnly},
    spiceLevel: ${preferences.spiceLevel},
    cuisine: ${preferences.cuisine},
    customCuisine: ${preferences.customCuisine}
  },
  "language": ${language}
}

---

### Processing Instructions:
- Verify ingredients by removing any items that are not valid foods.
- Adapt each recipe to reflect any specific requirements (traditional, quick-cook, beginner-friendly, or microwave-only) as specified in the preferences.
- Use the spiceLevel preference (0 to 100) as a guideline to adjust spice intensity.
- Use cuisine:
  - If the provided cuisine is a specific valid value (e.g., "chinese"), strictly base all recipes on that cuisine—using typical ingredients, seasonings, cooking methods, and flavor profiles—and set the output "cuisine" field to that value.
  - If the provided cuisine is "any" or is missing/invalid, do not apply a specific culinary tradition and set the output "cuisine" field to "none".
- Remove duplicate ingredients.
- Generate the recipe JSON as specified.

### Response Requirements:
- The recipe JSON must include a unique id, the provided cuisine (or "none" if the cuisine is "any" or missing/invalid), and a preference field that is an array containing only the applicable preferences for that recipe. The possible preference strings are: "Traditional", "Quick cook", "Beginner friendly", "Microwave only", and "Spicy". Include a string only if its corresponding input value is true (for "Spicy", include it only if spiceLevel > 0 and the recipe is intended to be spicy). Only in English for preferences even in Chinese recipe or Japanese recipe.
- At least one recipe must be generated that does not include "Spicy" in its preference array, even if spiceLevel > 0.
- **Ignore the provided language parameter; instead, the output must include each recipe translated into English, Chinese, and Japanese.**
- Generate the recipe JSON with the ingredients list where each ingredient object includes the fields "name", "portion" (numeric value), and "unit" (the measurement unit).
- All text in the output must be fully in the respective language for each translation.
- Return three different recipes in an object with keys 0, 1, and 2 in provided language. Only return recipe with one language (English, Chinese or Japanese).
- All recipes must strictly reflect the provided cuisine if it is specified and not "any". For example, if the cuisine is "chinese", every recipe must reflect Chinese culinary traditions and use typical ingredients and techniques.

Now generate the **mockRecipe** object using the given ingredients, preferences, and language.
